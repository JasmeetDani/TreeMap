# TreeMap
The project demonstrates the Squarified TreeMaps generation algorithm for displaying hierarchical data using nested rectangles.

The TreeMap is generated according to columns specified in the TreeMapTest script.

Max number of columns that can be specified is Column Count - 1.

"Occupancy" column is hardcoded as the column to be used for size and color.

Any other numeric columns can be used instead.



Hovering the mouse over the TreeMap gives details of the corresponding records in the database.

Left Click to Zoom In / Right Click to Zoom Out of the TreeMap.

Use MouseWheel to resize the TreeMap content.
